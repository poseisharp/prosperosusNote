# Draft 
Hi everyone, thanks for checking out Aonahara: Downfall 
we really appreciate it, We proudly anounce that 
it'll be released in Q1 of 2021.

This project started way back in late march as a visual
novel and set to release on the 1st of april, altho
a proof of concept has been made and is completely 
playable unfortunately I didn't manage to hit the deadline.

After missing the deadline I made the selfish choice
to scrap the whole project and start from sctratch
with much more ambitious scope

It's been a while since then, and i can't thank you
enough for all of the support.

While progress has been made, it's nowhere near
finished and along the way i've promised some people
that by this day i'll have something to show, 
and as you can see, i come empty handed,
It's purely the result of my incompetence 
and i have no excuses.
I'm very sorry to dissapoint you, you might lose trust
on me and that's understandable but i'll still do my best
to try and fix the problem.

Once again I'm sorry.
