# Actual story outline this time (maybe)

Nom Nom was a high school student on his last year.
After a stressful semester Nom can finally catch a break in the summer vacation,
he wanted to go to a place where he can just enjoy himself, and then he found out about Aonahara.
Since it's located at an unusual place there might be not much people there he thought.

Aonahara is one kind of a place and Nom was adapting fairly quick,
he initially planned to just be solitary and enjoy himself however since there's only a few people
it's where everyone knows everyone kind of situation and soon enough Nom is one of them,
on top of that most of the people who came to Aonahara share one common thing which is beliveing in the deities
so nom have easier time getting to know each other.

One day nom came up with an idea, he thought of helding some kind of class to learn more about the deities.
While it is true that most of the people here are intrigued by the deities they are still relying on the craftsmen,
even not all of the craftsmen are capable of understanding the deities to the fullest extent,
so nom asked people who've great understanding to teach, and fortunately they agreed.
The first class was a success.
Throughout his vacation nom managed the classes as the "principal" and did various activities.

Food saw the class promising for creating future craftsmen and Nearing the end of Nom's vacation 
Food offered to fully hire nom as a legitimate principal of the class and make it a real school,
Nom accepted the offer but he have to finish his school first and Food agreed.

Nom accepted the offer because he doesn't belive on the current path he's on
he's not failing school by any means but it doesn't sit right with him furthermore
it seems daunting for Nom and Food's offer opened up a new path for nom to take.

While nom is finishing his study, the Royal Craftsmen back at Aonahara and the neighboring Resort Beach 
was preparing a 5 days long festival to celebrate the year and to honor the deities.
Aonahara is not the only one that held a festival, other region that rely on deities also held one 
however Aonahara and the Resort wanted to go above and beyond.

After the festival ended the craftsmen were exhausted and anounced that they'll take a break for quite some time.
During the break the craftsmen stayed inside the basement and the food and water is abundance enough that they don't
have to go in and out just to grab a meal.

Not long After the festival ended Kitsune, Archer and Posei is conducting an experiment at Aonohana,
Kitsune got obtained a deity soul and he planned to combine it with normal life energy from human
in this case it is Posei's energy to see its effect and the experiment was a failure.
The moment they tried to combine it an explosion occured, no major injuries only minor trauma, 
however the room is in a complete mess so Kitsune decided to leave the room as is and 
will only clean it when he's on the mood to do so.

Kitsune made a communication system that allowed the craftsmen to communicate with each inside the basement 
and after the explosion occured it cease to function, but since everyone is taking a break they don't think
much about it, and telling Kitsune to fix it while everyone is at break doesn't feel right they thought.

A few day passes after the explosion, suddenly most of the craftsmen wanted to do something,
some want to start production again some wanted to pick up the things they long forgot etc.
Because most of the things the craftsmen wanted to do is outside of Aonahara they left and since it's still 
break time it should be fine they tought, leaving only a few in Aonahara.

Food sense something strange is going on inside the basement and told the remaining Leaders to be on high alert,
Nitsu is stationed to hold the choke point at the QA area, Egg is not present so food told Ren to hold TH,
for ED food appoint henry and because JDan is gone Posei is Holding the entrance to SB
Shern hold PR and lastly TL is at Moon's hand

A month after the break started nom finally ready to come back to Aonahara, ready to start his new life.
He arrived at the train station and run straight to Aonahara, upon arrival he saw familiar faces and they
welcome Nom gladly, after a mini reunion Nom is going to Jason's inn because he planned to stay there 
until he get a final settlement, on the way Nom met someone a cloaked person, Nom can't recognize him 
It might be a new person he thought so he decided to greet him but the person attacked Nom instead
and Nom fell unconcious.

Nom woke up inside one of the room of Jason's inn with Jason sitting right next to him
confused Nom asked who Jason was, Jason is surprised that nom couldn't remember him 
Jason explained that someone attacked Nom and he went unconscious.
There was a small red mark on Nom's forehead but that's about it
Strangely enough altho he can't recall anyone from Aonahara Nom still remember what is Aonahara
Jason told nom that he spent months in Aonahara
Jason convince Nom to stay and find out why he's here in the first place
The best choice is to meet the craftsmen but since they're all still on break
meeting the ex-craftsmen might be a good idea and there's two of them who still live in Aonahara
they are Emuwaa and Khanh, Nom can find Emu at the Shrine and Khanh around the main area of Aonahara
Before leaving Jason gave Nom a lemon candy and told him that it will give Nom a huge boost in his ability

*
Nom arrived at the miracle shrine, Nom saw Emu and approach and greet him
Nom explained the situation to Emu and asked emu to help him,
Emu agreed and suggested nom to visit the great archive and since there's no craftsmen around 
to ask for entrance emu offered his assistance.

Nom and Emu arrived at the main basement entrance   turns out that emu no longer have access
Emu and nom then go to the emergency exit
after arriving the lid is closed tight
knowing no other way emu decide to blow up the lid himself
then nom and emu descent into the basement
after climbing down the ladder they are now inside
the archieve building is visible from where they are rn due to its towering height
now they're on their way there.

Not long after they encounter some wild spirits
Emu explains to nom that they are 
the result of high concentration of life energy
which is a fairly commom occurence in the basement
since the area is densely packed with life energy from the deities
but not to this extent

Emu then asks nom to draw out his loom
Nom then realize having a loom despite not remembering where he got it from
Nom think that he must've got it when he was in Aonahara before
furthermore when Emu/Khanh tell him to exterminate the spirit with it
Nom know how to use it despite not remember learning using it
Now Emu/Khanh are now on their way to the great archieve

Upon arriving at the archieve Nom try to open the door but it is locked
he then try to knock on the door to which rushi responds and let them in
they then talks about the usual reunion stuff
Nom tell rushi that he actually can't remember the time he spent in Aonahara
and he's here to hopefully recover his memorry
after hearing that Rushi become highly alert 
and starting to asks all kind of questions to verify Nom
but since Rushi is asking questions that can only be answered 
by the Nom who didn't lose his memory Nom failed to convince Rushi
even when Emu/Khanh vouch for him Rushi won't budge
Rushi force nom and khanh/emu to leave immediately 
Outside Rushi draws out his loom and challenge Nom to a fight
This is the final verification from Rushi
If this nom is the real deal he will be able to fight rushi quite comfortably
and prove that the loom he brings isn't a stolen item
and if he can't Rushi successfully stop an intruder from wreaking havoc
It's a win win situation for him
Seeing no other choice Nom takes a stance and so is Khanh/Emu

Nom and Khanh/Rushi win
Without a word Rushi opens up the door and let them both in
Rushi then leads Nom to the area that documents history
Rushi finally convinced and he apologizes
Nom forgive Rushi and he understand that rushi is in no wrong
he's just trying to protect the archive
maybe a bit too much but still reasonable

Nom tell Khanh/Emu and Rushi that he's here to accept Food's offer
to become the principal of the school once again
Emu/Khanh encourages Nom to meet Food right away
then Nom asks rushi where's everyone anyway
Rushi answers that after the craftsmen held the festival 
everyone agreed to take a break for a while
at first people stayed inside the basement and lazed around
but soon they found out what they wanted to do while on break
the majority left Aonahara to do the things they want
only a couple of craftsmen remain Rushi is one of them
he always wanted to tidy up the archive and this is the perfect time
then nom asks Rushi is food even here
Rushi said he might be but not quite sure about it
the basement have a communication system built by kitsune
but It has stopped working for quite a while now
maybe Kitsune isn't here to fix it or he might be occupied with something else
without it Rushi can't confirm who's inside the basement and who isn't
he suggests Nom to just wait on the surface
Nom refuses and insists on meeting food as soon as possible
Rushi agrees and tell nom to meet Nitsu to get more information
Rushi can't assist nom since he have stuff to do with the archive first
Nitsu should be up north while nom can go straight there
but Rushi suggests nom to explore for a bit, it's quite a rare opportunity
to attain access (altho forcefully) to the basement for non craftsmen 
Nom keeps rusi's words in mind but he's main objective is till to meet Nitsu

when about to enter the boss area
Kahnh/Emu will propmt the player if they want to meet Nitsu right away
if yes then they'll enter the area
there'll be Nitsu already waiting for them
Nitsu then welcome nom back
because of the special occassion Nitsu invite nom to look around
Nitsu shows nom the shrine they built in the QA area
since nom want to know more about the deity this is a perfect opportunity
He of course have seen the shrine on the surface
however the shrine on the surface isn't built for one deity
this shrine is built specifically to respect the Comet deity
with the right mind and hearth nom will be able to connect more with the comet deity
and perhaps borrow some of her energy
Nitsu then shows Nom how he to send an offering to the shrine
Nitsu tells nom that by sending an offering nom can improve
his well being
while this "basement tour" is cool and all nom still have a goal in mind
he then cuts to the chase and asks Nitsu where he can find food
same answer as Rushi's, he might be still in Aonahara but not sure where exactly
he's guessing that food is still in the QA area
Nom jokingly complain that Nitsu's nose isn't good enough
he can smell the arrival Emu/Khanh and nom but not food
nitsu tells nom that it's tricky to smell anything covered by soil
back to it Nitsu asks nom back why does he want to meet food anyway
nom explains his situation
Nitsu understands however he refuses to let nom go further down
Nom and Kahnh/Emu starting to know where this is going
Nom requests for nitsu to at least let him know what are the reasons
he bargained that he came a long way just to get here 
if he have to wait at least he needs some kind of confirmation
Nitsu finally give in and explains to nom
a while ago food noticed something unusual is going on inside the Basement
then he puts all the role leader on high alert
the craftsment weren't told about this issue because food afraid this might be a false alarm
and to not cause panic he only notices the role leaders
Nitsu were stationed to hold this choke point
this is the only way to get deeper into the basement
and until further notice Nitsu shouldn't leave this under any condition
and to make matter worse this is all happened after the communication system broke down
and since kitsune is on break he might not be able to fix it anytime sone
Nitsu can't leave the current position
and he can't can't let nom go down on his own either
so to reiterate Nitsu tells nom that it is best for him to wait and wait until further notice
nom insists and starts to nit pick Nitsu's reasoning and hope he'll change his mind
this however only angers nitsu
Nitsu slowly steps back from Nom
nitsu tries to convice nom for the last time
the reason why Nitsu isn't letting Nom go down is for his own sake
because the basement is densely packed with life energy
someone who have great understanding of it can be a great threat
Nitsu points out how nom's loom can produce a lot more destructive power than on the surface
and if food were right and there's indeed someone who infiltrated the basement
things can get really messy real quick
he then asks for one more time
do nom still insists on going down
Emu/Khanh whispers to Nom that they understand where this is going
and if nom decides to do it they're will do their best
and the chance of getting of getting beaten up is off the chart
they will stay beside nom
nom nods
noms then answers yes
Nitsu draws his loom and points it at nom
"then prove that you're capable"

nom and Emu/Khanh wins
now that Nom have proved himself 
he tells Nitsu to let him through
Nothing but silent comes from Nitsu
after a while Nitsu finally speaks
instead of giving a yes or no to nom's question
Nitsu tells nom to go to the surface with him immediately
nom is furious about the sudden change of mind
they just fought each other like there's no tomorrow
for nitsu just to change his mind
that doesn't make any sense, he says
surprisingly nitsu agrees
no matter how you look at it, this doesn't make any sense
the whole thing is off
There's no reason for Nitsu to guard this place the whole time
while it's true that an order from food should be carried out
There's a lot of other options nitsu could takes
but it didn't even cross his mind
Nitsu afraid that food suspicion is true
Nom is beyond confused by nitsu's word
even khanh/emu doesn't even understand what is Nitsu on about
Nitsu closes his eyes and sniffs around
he then says how many people is still in the QA area
// this is to tell the player how many optional bosses they missed
however Nitsu still suggest for them to go to the surface rn
and they can just inform the rest later

Using nitsu's access they use the main lift to get back to the surface
they arrive at the main entrance 
nitsu tells nom to meet him in Jason's inn
he's going to search for any craftsmen first and invite them too

Nitsu gathers everyone he can find at the surface
here they are now at the inn
everyone besides nitsu is clueless to what's going on
they just think that Nitsu is helding a gathering to welcome nom
however nitsu is here to discuss an important matter
"Something's off"
everyone goes quite and confused
Nom asks nitsu to elborate
Nitu tells them about food's suspicion
a while ago food felt something unusual was going on inside the basement
and he told the role leaders to be on hight alert
if someone infiltrates the basement 
nitsu will instantly know due to his incredible sense of smell
that's why he is stationed in the very first line of defense
however Nitsu is sure 
that only the craftsmen have entered and leave the basement
with the only exception of nom and emu/khanh
still confused Jason asks nitsu 
so what's this something off Nitsu keep talking about
