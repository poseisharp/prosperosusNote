controlled by a SkillsHud.tscn
it's a control node
with 2 texture rects for the skills
and and overlay? (idk what will it be)
that can be set partially, maybe a progress bar?
and on top it displays the countdown timer (if it's on cooldown)


- Create a scene for the skills [X]
- Create 2 Texture Rects as placeholder for the skills [X]
- on ready function replace those texture rect with the actual skills [X]
