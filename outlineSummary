I don't know how to properly put this into text form but i'll try my best.

Before we get into the actual story here's some things to keep in mind:
1. The player can have a party up to 4 members, but nom himself can't be removed from the party.
There's a special slot reserved for story so technically the player can have up to 5 party member.
2. The player can only equip weapon, accessory and one consumable / character.
3. Enemy only drop life energy upon defeated which is the main currency of the game, however some enemies  
will drop special items.
4. Weapon and accessory is obtained though purchase, boss drop, and from loot chest scattered through the map.
5. "//" is indicating a comment from me and not part of the story itself

Summary

Nom arrive at the train station
he then walk to aonahara
along the way he meet some people and talk for a bit
as he continue his walk he approached by someone
nom coudln't tell who is it because of the clothing the person wear
and before he realize it nom is attacked and fall unconscious

Nom wake up at jason's inn
jason is sitting right next to him
Nom ask where he is and what happened and lastly who is jason
jason is surprised that nom couldn't remember him 
he explained that someone attacked him and he went unconscious
there's a small red mark on nom's forehead but that's about it
Strangely enough altho he can't recall anyone from Aonahara Nom still remember what is Aonahara
Jason tells nom that he spent months in Aonahara
Jason convince Nom to stay and find out why he's here in the first place

After leaving Jason's inn nom asks around the area
People are saying that the craftsmen can help
but they're still resting after the festival
However the ex craftsmen Khanh and Emu are still around

> Scenario A: Nom meet Emu
Nom arrive at the miracle shrine and talk with Emu
Nom explains the situation to Emu
and asks emu to help him remember
Emu suggest nom to visit the great archive
but since there's no craftsmen around to ask for entrance emu offers his assistance
after arriving at the main basement entrance 
turns out that emu no longer have access
Emu and nom then go to the emergency exit
after arriving the lid is closed tight
knowing no other way emu decide to blow up the lid himself
then nom and emu descent into the basement
after climbing down the ladder they are now inside
the archieve building is visible from where they are rn due to its towering height
now they're on their way there.

> Scenario B: Nom meet Khanh
Arrived at the cental area of Aonahara nom meet with Khanh
Nom explains the situation to Khanh
Eager to help, Khanh invite nom to find the craftsmen and seek help
Khanh offer nom to help get inside the basement.
after arriving at the main basement entrance 
turns out that Khanh no longer have access
Khanh then decided to enter the basemenet via the water tunnel
after going through the tunnel 
they both lands on a large body of water near the basement garden
from there they can see the great archieve in the distance
and it become their first destination

// Some kind of combat tutorials
Not long after they encounter some wild spirits
Emu/Khanh explains to nom that they are 
the result of high concentration of life energy
which is a fairly commom occurence in the basement
since the area is densely packed with life energy from the deities
but not to this extent

// The weapon on the lore is called "loom"
Emu/Khanh then asks nom to draw out his loom
Nom then realize having a loom despite not remembering where he got it from
Nom think that he must've got it when he was in Aonahara before
furthermore when Emu/Khanh tell him to exterminate the spirit with it
Nom know how to use it despite not remember learning using it
Now Emu/Khanh are now on their way to the great archieve

// If the player decided to explore other area other than to the west
// Emu/Khanh will prompt the player to focus on the great archieve first

Upon arriving at the archieve Nom try to open the door but it is locked
he then try to knock on the door to which rushi responds and let them in
they then talks about the usual reunion stuff
Nom tell rushi that he actually can't remember the time he spent in Aonahara
and he's here to hopefully recover his memorry
after hearing that Rushi become highly alert 
and starting to asks all kind of questions to verify Nom
but since Rushi is asking questions that can only be answered 
by the Nom who didn't lose his memory Nom failed to convince Rushi
even when Emu/Khanh vouch for him Rushi won't budge
Rushi force nom and khanh/emu to leave immediately 
Outside Rushi draws out his loom and challenge Nom to a fight
This is the final verification from Rushi
If this nom is the real deal he will be able to fight rushi quite comfortably
and prove that the loom he brings isn't a stolen item
and if he can't Rushi successfully stop an intruder from wreaking havoc
It's a win win situation for him
Seeing no other choice Nom takes a stance and so is Khanh/Emu

Nom and Khanh/Rushi win
Without a word Rushi opens up the door and let them both in
Rushi then leads Nom to the area that documents history
Nom look through the archives and little by little 
everything starting to come together
and before too long nom regained his memory back
Rushi finally convinced and he apologizes
Nom forgive Rushi and he understand that rushi is in no wrong
he's just trying to protect the archive
maybe a bit too much but still reasonable

Nom tell Khanh/Emu and Rushi that he's here to accept food's offer
to become the principal of the school once again
Emu/Khanh then encourage Nom to meet Food right away
but Rushi halt Khanh/Emu's idea
The basement have a communication system 
built by Kitsune for the craftsmen to communicate
but it doesn't seems to be working for the past couple of weeks
