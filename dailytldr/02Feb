Nom joined gamedesign
Reworked Task Management System

Khanh Initial Sprite is done 

Cum stained sword design finalized:
A sheathed bamboo sword
The item description:
"A bamboo sword... With the sheath on. I guess Nom didn't remove it"
After nom unlock its true potential it become turned into: Unsheated bamboo sword
The item description:
"a better bamboo sword... Actually Nom just realized to remove the sheath. Was it this powerful the entire time?"

We're now going to have idle animation for each character
Some concepts for the characters:
Nitsu would go sleep like a dog. Where they curl up to their tail.
Nom would have that thing where she has a bubble come out her nose.
Emu would just sit down legs wide arms to the side.

Nitsu lost his ears
In exchange for wagging tails

In the end posei didn't manage to finish the outline :aquadogeza:
