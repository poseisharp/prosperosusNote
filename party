Party system (probably):

requirements:
- characters
- save data / database?


responsibility:
- provide a list of current party member
- managing party member (add, remove, change)
- swaping active character 

current problem:
- camera switch is janky as hell
- the entity is only paused and will be continued
when switched back
- all ongoing nodes will abpruptly be paused and
continued

possible fixes:
- don't remove the character scene, but instead
hide them
- use a separate container to be the owner of 
all character's effects

weird things that might happen with solution 1:
- when something new added to the character 
the script of hiding them might have to be updated
- each character would have their own unique hiding
script which isn't great design pattern

weird things that might happen with solution 2:
- is a big hassle to set up
- some effects like particles and audio 
will be separated from the character itself 
which mean that it would be a headache to set each
character properties

solution 1:
- what is it the thing that is neccesary to be hiden?
1. probably the sprites (all sprites)
2. disable hitboxes
3. disable any input 
- what is the thing that need to be kept?
1. skills effect
2. particles effect
3. projectiles

what if i try to hide them and not call a new instance
to avoid uneccessary stats carry over

alrighty

ok what the fuck it kinda works???
but still need some polish
after i eat that is


## Fully implementing solution 1

- provide a list of current party member [X]
- spawning all party members [X]
