# Where are we now
We divide the development phases into the following:
- early build
- playable build
- combat build
- feature complete build
- content complete build
- full release build

as of now we're currently nearing the end of combat build with only
a few more features to work on before having a combat-ready build

# A change in workflow
There were a couple of problems on the previous workflow that's why we're going to change it

## Problems with previous workflow

### Tasks are often too vague
When this happen even if we want to do it we don't have any clue what to do
this may lead into ignoring the ask alltogether

### Things slow down when there's no visible progress
When there's not much visible movement people we often start to momentum

## New workflow

### Deletion of #Prosperosus-tasks
yeah

### Biweekly Meeting
A non mandatory meeting that aims to solve mentioned problems
time of meeting: TBD

there are two recurring agendas on the meeting
- Review and report of tasks
- New tasks assignment

Previously assigned tasks progress will be reported and to see if there's any problem with it
after that, new tasks will naturally be born and those tasks
will be assigned on the meeting, also the task will be described in a detailed manner to clear up any confusion

### Deadline
The project failed to hit deadline time after time so to solve this we're going to have no deadline
